# Keyword to define the boundary condition:
# ADMI: Normalized admittance boundary condition
# PRES: Pressure boundary condition
# VELO: Velocity boundary condition
# NOTE: Mesh2HRTF expects normalized admittances, i.e., admittance/(rho*c).
#       rho is the density of air and c the speed of sound. The normalization is
#       beneficial because a single material file can be used for simulations
#       with differing speed of sound and density of air.

# Frequency curve:
# NumCalc performs an interpolation in case the boundary condition is required
# at frequencies that are not specified. The interpolation is linear between the
# lowest and highest provided frequency and uses the nearest neighbor outside
# this range.
